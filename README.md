## Yet Another Rubik's Cube
The project is relatively old and at that time I didn't really care much about providing any projects files along with the source.
This code was imported from Google Code as-is and is mostly of a historical value to me.

### Controls
* Cursor keys - move virtual cursor across the cube
* Ctrl/Alt - rotate cube fragment
* Shift + cursor keys - rotate cube
* M - menu
